A postmortem (also known as a post-mortem analysis or retrospective) is a process of reviewing and analyzing a completed project, event, or situation after it has concluded. The term "postmortem" is derived from the medical field, where it refers to an examination of a deceased body to determine the cause of death. In a non-medical context, a postmortem involves assessing what went well, what went wrong, and what could be improved upon in order to enhance future performance and outcomes.

Postmortems are commonly used in various fields, including business, software development, project management, and emergency response. The purpose of conducting a postmortem is to:

Identify successes and failures: A postmortem helps to highlight the achievements and positive aspects of a project or event, as well as the areas where things didn't go as planned.

Learn from mistakes: By analyzing failures, errors, and challenges, teams can gain insights into what went wrong and why, allowing them to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

Improve processes: Postmortems facilitate the identification of inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas where processes could be optimized or streamlined.

Foster a culture of continuous improvement: Encouraging regular postmortem analyses helps teams develop a mindset of continuous learning and growth, leading to better performance over time.

Enhance communication: Postmortems encourage open and honest communication within teams, as participants are encouraged to share their perspectives and insights without fear of blame.

During a postmortem, participants typically discuss what was planned, what was achieved, what obstacles were encountered, and what lessons were learned. They may also brainstorm actionable recommendations for future projects or events. The goal is to gather valuable insights that can be used to drive improvements in processes, strategies, and outcomes going forward.
